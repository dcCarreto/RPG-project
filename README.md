# Text-Based RPG Project Inspired by *Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition*   

---

## **Overview**  
A personal project for a **text-based RPG** inspired by the *D&D 5e Player's Handbook*. The initial vision was to create a **turn-based game** where players progress through immersive storytelling, strategic choices, and character development.  

### **Core Vision**  
- **Turn-Based Mechanics**: Combat and exploration driven by D&D-inspired rules.  
- **Progressive Gameplay**: Unlock abilities, level up, and uncover secrets as you advance.  
- **Unity Integration**: The final build was planned to be developed in **Unity** for enhanced interactivity and UI.

## **Project Goals**  
1. Build a modular system for character creation (races, classes, backgrounds).  
2. Implement D&D 5e combat rules (AC, saving throws, spell slots).  
3. Design a short demo campaign (e.g., "The Lost Arcane Crystal").  
4. Prototype UI/UX in Unity for future scalability.

## **Future Vision**  
- Multiplayer support via LAN or online connectivity.  
- Expanded bestiary using the *D&D Monster Manual*.  
- Dynamic event system with procedurally generated quests.  

**Letâ€™s roll initiative!**
