# Text-Based RPG Project Inspired by *Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition* 🐉⚔️  

---

## 📜 **Overview**  
A personal project for a **text-based RPG** inspired by the *D&D 5e Player's Handbook*. The initial vision was to create a **turn-based game** where players progress through immersive storytelling, strategic choices, and character development.  

### **Core Vision**  
- **Turn-Based Mechanics**: Combat and exploration driven by D&D-inspired rules.  
- **Progressive Gameplay**: Unlock abilities, level up, and uncover secrets as you advance.  
- **Unity Integration**: The final build was planned to be developed in **Unity** for enhanced interactivity and UI.
